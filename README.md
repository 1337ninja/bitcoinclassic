What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Classic software, see https://bitcoinclassic.com.

What is Bitcoin Classic?
------------------------

Bitcoin Classic is currently a one-time increase in total amount of transaction data permitted in a block from 1MB to 2MB, with limits on signature operations and hashing. We will have ports for master and 0.11.2, so that miners and businesses can upgrade to 2 MB blocks from any recent bitcoin software version they run.

Read the [block size increase BIP](https://github.com/gavinandresen/bips/blob/92e1efd0493c1cbde47304c9711f13f413cc9099/bip-bump2mb.mediawiki) for more information.

In the future Bitcoin Classic will continue to release updates that are in line with Satoshiâ€™s whitepaper & vision, and are agreed upon by the community.

Development Process
-------------------

The classic team uses two branches, a stable and an develop branch. The stable is one that
has only tested code on it and this is where releases are made from. The 'develop' branch
is used for actual development and that branch should be used with caution.

The 'master' branch is unused and just follows the upstream for now.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Complicated or controversial changes should be discussed within the community before working on a patch set.
