What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Classic software, see https://bitcoinclassic.com.

License
-------

Bitcoin Classic is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The classic team uses two branches, a stable and an develop branch. The stable is one that
has only tested code on it and this is where releases are made from. The 'develop' branch
is used for actual development and that branch should be used with caution.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
